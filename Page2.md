## Analysis of ArcGIS Insights

What surprised me the most while working through the assignment’s exercises was just how easy it was to use ArcGIS Insights. Even on my 8+ year old laptop, virtually everything I did on Insights was quick and easy to do. I only faced system lagging during the later steps in the UNHCR exercise due to the large number of windows open in the program. By contrast, it took me 12 whole credits of a master’s program just to gain a proficient understanding of ArcGIS Pro. I am not sure you could stretch an Insights course over half that time. I was particularly happy at being able to use the software to map human rights patterns over decades of time and compare them quickly and easily. Given that I specialize in human rights and am currently pursuing similar work, I was pleased to see how fast I could visualize such complex information (“person of concern” attachment). Also impressive was that some of the visualization options are either not available in Pro or are tucked away in some crevice of the maze-like interface. The link map feature is not in Pro as far as I know. The ability to immediately show connections between data is a big advantage Insights has over Pro.

However, I repeatedly wondered if I would be able to use this program in my current master’s capstone project. I am using ArcGIS Pro to map many data sets related to public transportation and the inclusion of underserved communities in Pennsylvania and this requires sophisticated analysis tools like k-means clustering (“notmodular” attachment). I realized that Insights would not be able to help me in this case simply due to the limited amount of tools it has. I also could not help but think of how much of a nightmare data cleaning would be in Insights compared to Pro. It seems that Insights is great for exploratory data analysis and creating interactive visualization tools that can be easily distributed, but detailed quantitative analysis is better suited with Pro.

Another thing that struck me was the lack of presentation software available in Insights. The ability to paste the code of a fancy interactive chart with multiple windows into Github was certainly impressive, but Pro has many other presentation materials available. In addition to their Storymap and Dashboard services, the ability to create professional Layouts is a serious advantage of Pro. I could see recommending Insights for an NGO or small company, but I am better off knowing Pro since I plan on working for places that can afford it like the federal government and international organizations. Had I taken a course on ArcGIS Insights instead, I doubt I would have gotten my money’s worth.
