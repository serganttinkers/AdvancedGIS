## Discussion on Spatial Data Science Methods and the ArcGIS Notebooks Feature

To be perfectly honest, I finished the Notebooks exercise wondering how I would be able to use this feature. While I have R experience from an introductory course last mini, I do not have Python experience and may not have it for a while. I am wrapping up the GIS component of my systems project and I cannot think of a time when this tool would have been worth the time it would take to develop a proficient understanding of its use. After looking up the Notebooks feature a little bit more, I remembered that despite there being three people on my systems team with ArcGIS experience, I am the only one doing any work on this program. The fact that geodatabases contain multiple folders of data and require numerous steps both on and off the program just to manipulate the data means that sharing in-progress work with others or sharing ArcGIS work is difficult and impractical.

While I am not really capable of using the Notebooks feature with my current need and lack of Python experience, I can recognize how it would be useful for a team of people. By simply sharing the data used in a geospatial analysis and performing the analytical work in a Notebook, the steps required to complete the work could be shared much more easily and mitigate the necessary work. However, I think this is only practical in a team of people able to use both the mainstay ArcGIS Pro features and the Notebooks feature, which I imagine significantly narrows the sort of groups which could use it. As such, I think the Notebooks feature is mostly limited to GIS-specific teams instead of mixed-skill teams. I cannot imagine using it alone, as so much of the benefit of GIS comes from the hands-on interaction with data that it facilitates, and writing the steps into code removes this benefit.

The data engineering tools used in the second exercise, however, seem highly useful. The whole time I was working on the exercise, I kept reopening my systems GIS project and seeing how I could use the tools presented here. Much of my data is categorical in nature and so I am unable to use many of the data engineering features available, but the histogram-based features would certainly be usable. I plan on using it to show the types of data available within specific types of census tracts in Pennsylvania.

I also appreciated how easy it was to compare the statistical relationships between different variables and how they vary by location, such as with the scatterplot matrix tool. I could have used it during my final project in the previous GIS course, where I mapped brain drain effects in Wyoming (link found in the README document). Here, I tried to show the relationships between different data to understand population trends. I did well enough using a cluster analysis, but it may have been just as helpful to use the scatterplot matrix tool to measure now strongly correlated different population trends are. This may have been useful in showing which specific variables are correlated with brain drain and how they change across the state. Depending on the findings, this could have been used to generate some meaningful recommendations for what future research should start with instead of simply saying that further research is necessary. 

I think I will be using the data engineering tools in part two of the homework exercises during future exploratory data analysis. Some of the functions here are feasible simply by using different spatial joins and exporting selected features, but the data engineering features are clearly designed to reduce the amount of work necessary to get a better product.
