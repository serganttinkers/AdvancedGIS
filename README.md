# About Me

I am completing my Masters in Public Policy and Management degree at Carnegie Mellon University this May. I have always had an interest in foreign policy and so my degree concentrates in human rights and global development. I am currently pursuing career opportunities in policy think tanks, international development organizations, and the US federal government to begin upon completion of my degree. 

I initially began taking GIS because my academic advisor said it would be a highly marketable skill and few public policy schools provide it. After completing a semester-long course on GIS, I learned how useful geospatial analysis is for understanding human behavior. My specialization in global development and human rights means I credible or consistent data can be difficult to obtain in this area. However, the emergent nature of geospatial data exploration gives a unique perspective on existing data that can help an anlyst fill in the blanks that would otherwise be a headache on a mere Excel sheet.

# What I Hope to Learn

I have already applied to several positions which would greatly benefit from geospatial analysis skills. For example, I recently applied for a position with Human Rights Watch to perform research on ethnic/racial minorities in a specific region. GIS analysis makes it possible to more meaningfully understand the environment and circumstances of certain groups of people that simply would not be feasible with mere census data. I hope to expand on my current understanding of GIS and apply this experience in a variety of human rights contexts. I am particuarly interested in learning to use tools other that ArcGIS, as expensive GIS software is not as accessible in in human rights and development work.
