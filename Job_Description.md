The Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch is seeking a researcher on racism and discrimination in Europe, covering the European Union and the United Kingdom. This is a three-year fixed term full-time position with the possibility of extension dependent on funding.
The Researcher will carry out research, communications, and advocacy work on the human rights implications of racism and discrimination based on racial, ethnic or religious identity in the European Union and the United Kingdom.
